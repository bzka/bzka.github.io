[ERROR 404](./another-page.html).

So, I'm planning to use this site to share updates about what I'm working on.
In the next few weeks, I'll be moving the site to my own domain and making some improvements to make it more enjoyable for everyone. 
Additionally, I'll be posting updates about the development of my game. 
That's pretty much it for now; more updates to come soon!
